# ModSecurity + Nginx Installation Guide

## üìå Overview
**ModSecurity** is an open-source **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** that helps protect your web applications from a wide range of attacks, including:

- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- And other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

Originally, ModSecurity was **developed for the Apache HTTP Server** in 2002 by Ivan Ristiƒá.  
Later, it was rewritten as **libmodsecurity (ModSecurity v3)**, making it possible to integrate with **other web servers** such as **Nginx** and **IIS**.

This repository provides **two ways** to install and configure ModSecurity with Nginx:
1. **Manual Installation** ‚Äî follow the step-by-step instructions in `manual.md`.
2. **Automated Installation** ‚Äî run the included shell script to install ModSecurity with a single command.
