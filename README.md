# 🚀 Devhouse - My DevOps Journey

Welcome to my **Devhouse** repo — this is where I document everything I’m learning, building, breaking (and fixing 😅) during my time at Devhouse. From Linux internals to AWS deployments — it's all here.

## 📚 What I'm Learning

- ✅ Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat)
- ✅ Shell scripting (bash, cron, awk, sed)
- ✅ Networking (iptables, ufw, TCP/IP, DNS, etc.)
- ✅ MariaDB (Replication, Tuning, Backups)
- ✅ NGINX + HAProxy + Keepalived
- ✅ GitHub Actions + CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ Docker + Containers
- 🔜 Proxmox VE
- 🔜 AWS Cloud (EC2, IAM, VPC, S3)
- 🔜 Terraform (coming soon 👀)

Things I add here:
- Real-life configs from production/staging
- Things that broke & how I fixed them
- Deep dive notes on topics I learned
- My opinions on what worked & what was confusing
