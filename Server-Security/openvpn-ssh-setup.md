# ðŸ”’ Secure SSH Access with OpenVPN

**OpenVPN** is an open-source VPN solution that allows you to create secure, encrypted tunnels between your client and server. By using OpenVPN and restricting SSH to listen only on the VPN interface, you ensure that only users connected via VPN can access your server â€” blocking all direct SSH attempts from the public internet.
